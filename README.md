# TV-Viewership-and-Title-Analysis
A project analysing viewership and episode titles of the Real Housewives of New York City over time, using data scraped from wikipedia. Completed as a part of my MSc Software Development Programming and Algorithms unit in January 2024. The subject matter is certainly informal, however interesting formal techniques are used to draw interesting analysis about numerate structures as well as coverage on the ethics of gender.

## Techniques covered:
- Webscraping: Cast/viewership data from wikipedia tables 
- Feature engineering: Cast/viewership data cleaning and processing 
- Linear Regression Models: Predicting viewership, with various functional components and analysis/evaluation
- Hypothesis testing: Testing significance of regression coefficients and Correlation coefficients
- NLP: Feature engineering and analysis of titles (this is light NLP, more sophisticated techniques are used in my text analytics coursework - to be uploaded soon)
- Ethical reflection of gender presentation in media and Bravo's 'Real Housewives' franchise

## Files:
- rhony_code.ipynb: markdown/code file, with comments and analysis (the main project)
- rhony_episodes_df.csv: cleaned dataframe extracted from wikipedia
- title_word_count.csv: processed dataframe on frequency of words in titles

## Notes:
- All data was scraped from wikipedia and is used for academic purposes
- This project was submitted as a part of my Data Science MSc (2024)
- The subject matter is light-hearted, but the analysis is methodical and data-driven
